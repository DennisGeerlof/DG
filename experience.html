    <h1>Experience</h1>
    <p>
    At the moment I am a 3rd year student studying Software Developer at MboRijnland in Gouda.<br>
    In my second year I was interning at Edit4U for half a year.<br>
    At this time I was mainly busy with front-end development<br> using a CMS (Joomla).
    This year (the second half of the year)<br> I will also intern at a company which I have not chosen yet.<br>
    At this company I will also make my exams which means<br> after interning I will get my certificate.
